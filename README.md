### Taylor Polynomial Interactive Visualization

*File Location: taylor.js*

The **Taylor Polynomial Interactive Visualization** for the National Museum of Mathematics *Math Square* exhibit creates the opportunity for collaborative, hands-on exploration of one of the most fascinating, powerful results of calculus: the Taylor expansion.

#### Interactive Visualization with Math Square

This exhibit allows a group of museum goers to see the power of Taylor polynomials firsthand. For each museum viewer detected on the *Math Square* by its sensors, the visualization adds an additional term to the finite Taylor expansion of the underlying function. The Taylor expansions and the function that they are approximating are graphed alongside each other on the same set of axes, illustrating their relationship and showing the power granted by additional terms. Museum goers are encouraged to invite passers-by to join in on the fun as they endeavor to build the best possible approximation.

#### About Taylor Series

Infinitely differentiable, real or complex-valued functions can be expanded into an equivalent infinite series, known as a *Taylor series*. This can allow transcendental functions like sine, cosine and the exponential function to be expressed in terms of power series with elegant properties.

Finite Taylor polynomials, consisting of the first *n* terms of a Taylor series, can provide a useful approximation of the underlying function. With an increasing number of terms, this approximation improves. The Taylor series, with infinitely many terms, converges to the function itself.

#### Exhibit Features

* Multiple functions: exponential function, sine, cosine
* Displays Taylor polynomials concurrently with the function
* Taylor polynomials graphed up to the 7th term
* Interactive & collaborative: passers-by join in on the fun! Build the best possible approximation
* Helps the audience develop intuition for the nature of the Taylor series
